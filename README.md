Rotten food is a serious issue in the food supply chain. Using gas sensors (MQ series) along with temperature and humidity readings, this system analyzes the "time left to rot" of fruits and vegetables. The dataset is collected using Arduino-based sensor modules and multiple gas sensors (MQ2, MQ3, MQ4, MQ5, MQ9, MQ135) along with DHT22 (Temp & Humidity).

The model is trained to predict how many hours are left before the banana becomes rotten, helping vendors or consumers take proactive actions.

⚙️ This project is still in progress — I'm currently expanding the dataset by collecting sensor readings from more fruits like apples and grapes.
